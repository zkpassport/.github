# Welcome!

ZKpassport is a privacy-first identity solution designed to bring secure, unforgeable proof of identity to Web3. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, we enable users to verify their identity without revealing sensitive personal data.

## Why ZKpassport?
With ZKpassport, we aim to solve the identity challenge in Web3, providing:
- **Privacy**: Users can prove who they are without revealing personal information.
- **Security**: Built with cutting-edge cryptography, ensuring identity data remains secure.
- **Interoperability**: Designed to work across decentralized applications and platforms.

## Our Vision
We're building identity infrastructure for the decentralized future. Our goal is to create a system that is **Sybil-resistant**, **non-KYC-based**, and free from the need for **sensitive document custodianship**. With ZKpassport, identity is **self-sovereign** and **privacy-preserving**.
